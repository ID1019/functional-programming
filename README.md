# ID1019 - Programming II
This is a **course in functional and concurrent programming** given at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

The programming language used was originally Erlang but we're now moving to Elixir.



### Lectures

There will be 14 lectures that will go through the concepts of
functional and concurrent programming. We will use Elixir as an
example language but the lectures are more focused on the bigger
picture. Learning Elixir is something you best learn when programming.

### Exercises

It is highly encouraged to do several of the exercises. Once you get the
knack of it they are quite easy and vill hopefully give you some
deeper knowledge about functional and concurrent programming besides
learning Elixir.

### Seminars

The seminars that we will use each year will be a subset of the
exercises. During the seminars we will discuss how to best solve
problems and pros and cons of alternative solutions
