\section*{Introduction}

This is an exercise in building an interactive game with two players
coordinated by one Elixir game engine. We will build the application
as a set of communicating processes where some processes are handling
the lower communication layers, one process is responsible for the
game logic and one to supervise and coordinate the actions. We will
use a web interface to handle the graphical dsiplay and forward input
from the players so there is some limited HTML and JS programing
involved.

The true reasoin why you want to do this exercise is of course that
the Pong game was a epiq game, one of the first console games, that
changed the world for ever. 

\section*{The game of Pong}

The game of Pong is a very simple model of a game of tennis. The two
opponents can only move their paddle up and down along the base line
and the bal will bounce of the walls on the upper and lower side
walls. If a player fails to return the ball by having the paddle in
the right position she looses a point and the opponent gets to serve a
new ball.

A ball will bounce of the side walls in a perfect reflection but the
bounce from a paddle is slightly off depending on how far from the
center of the paddle that ball hits i.e. not the movement of the
paddle. This behaviour will simulate spinning the ball and allows you
make a tougher return for the opponent to catch.

The classical Atari Game of Pong was played using a small console
attached to a TV. In our implementation we will of course use the
Internet and allow the two players to be anywhere as long as they have
a network connection. The look and feel should however be as in the orignal version shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pong}.

\section*{The architecture}
  
When we implement this game it is a lot easier to first divide the
system into processes that handle various aspects of the game. The
system will consist of: a client part, processes on the server side
that handles the communication with each player, a server process that
starts the game and keeps the game state and a module that describes
the rules of the game. The architecture is outlined in Fig.~\ref{fig:arch}. 

\subsection*{the client}

The client processes (browser 1 and 2 in Fig.~\ref{fig:arch}) will be
web browser that are responsible for displaying the game and forward
user interaction. The client beahviour is implemented in JavaScript
and found in {\tt pong.js}. Since this is not a course in web design
we will keep it as simple as possible and I don't think we could do it
any simpler.

The communication between the clients and
the server will be solved using something called {\em web
  sockets}. This is a bidirectional message protocol that is
iniatiated through a HTTP request. On the client side this will be
handled by teh JavaScript WebSocket library but on the server side we
will have to implement everything from scratch (or use the version you
will find in the git repo).

\subsection*{the server}

The heart of the system is the {\tt server} process. It is the process
that we first start and it is responsible for handling the game
state. To make the communication with the clients easier we add two
layers between the server and the clients. The low level details of
decoding and encoding websocket messages is handled by a {\tt handler}
process. It wil deliver messages as byte sequences to a {\tt session}
process that will translate the byte sequnces to more comprehendible
mesages that are delivered to the server. The session process will
also encode messages from teh server to byte sequences before sending
them to the handler process.

The server process holds the state of the game and acts on either
client messages or clock ticks (wich will move the ball forward) but
it does not know much about how the game actually work. The game logic
is all defined in a module called {\tt Game}. This is where we decide
what to do if a user wants to move up or down or what happens if the
ball has moved. The Game module will know everything aboy how large
the court is, how balls bounce etc, it's much easier to keep all of
the details in one module.

\subsection*{the websocket layer}

The server will start by creating two processes, one {\tt session}
process for each player. It will then creat a {\tt socket} process
that is given the process identifiers of the two session
processes. The socket process will open a TCP listening socket on a
specified port and then spawn two processes that wait for incomming
connections.

To describe how the websocket protocol works in detail is a bit outside
the scope of this exercise so let's only go through it breifly. A
client will open a connection by opening a TCP connection and then
send special HTTP request. This request will specify that it wants to
communicate over the websocket protocol so the server responds and
then keeps the connection open.

The clinent and the server can then communicate by sending encoded
message. The body of a message is a byte sequence so it up to us to
come up with a encoding of our messages as a byte sequence.

In order to handle the incoming messages the handler process will
spawn a decoder process that will listen and decode messages comming
from the client. Some low level socket messages it can reply to itself
but when it has received a proper message it will send it to the
handler process.

The handler process will receive messages from the decoder process and
forward them to its session process. If the decoder process detects
that the socket is closed it will inform the hanlder who then will
relay this information to the session process and then terminate.

The reason why the handler process chooses to spawn a decoder process
is that if it would read from the socket itself, it would be suspended
waiting for messages on the socket. A message from the session process
could then be dealyed and not delivered in time. There are other ways
to solve this but in this sitiation it is easier to spawn a new
process that suspends reading from teh socket while the handler
process is ready to receive messages from either the decoder or the
session process.

\subsection*{the session layer}

In Fig.\ref{fig:seq} the initalisation of the system is shown. The
server process is started first and it spawns two session processes
giving them unique names ({\tt :player1}, {\tt :player1}). The server
then spawns the {\tt websocket} process that opens the specified TCP
port. The process is also given the process identifiers of the two
session porcesses. The websocet process then spwans the two hanlder
processes that will, when they receive a connection, report back to
their session processes that they are open. 

Once the session process receivs the messages from a handler process
it will report back to the server process that it is ready to start
the game. The server process will wait for both session processes to
report and can then serve the first ball. 

During the game teh session process is responsible for endocding and
decoding messages between the pong server and the client browser.

The messages from the handler process to the session proces are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt \{:ws, pid, :open\}}  : a connection was establishes
\item {\tt \{:ws, pid, :close\}} : the connection was closed by the client
\item {\tt \{:ws, pid, \{:msg,  <<?U, _::binary>>\}\}} : player pressed up arrow
\item {\tt \{:ws, pid, \{:msg,  <<?D, _::binary>>\}\}} : player pressed down arrow
\end{itemize}

The messages generated when the player presses either the up or down
arrow are deoded and delivered to the pong server as {\tt\{:pong1,
  :up\}} and {\tt\{:player1, :down\}}. The session process knows if it
is handling {\tt :player1} or {\tt :player2} and can thus generat the
right messages. Note that the client process can not decide by its own
that a paddle should be moved, it only passes the request to move to
the pong server. It is the server that decides in what order things
should move.

The pong server constanly send messahes to the client, directing it to
move paddles, the ball or update the score. These messages needs to be
encoded as byte sequences. These are the messages from the pong erver
and how they are encoded:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt \{:player1, :up\}}  : player 1 moved up -  {\tt <<?P,?U>>}
\item {\tt \{:player1, :down\}}  : player 1 moved down - {\tt <<?P,?D>>}
\item {\tt \{:player1, :score, score\}}  : player 1 new score - {\tt <<?P,?S, score>>}
\item {\tt \{:player2, ... \}} : same messages for player 2 -  {\tt <<?O, ... >>}        
\item {\tt \{:ball, x, y \}} : ball moved  - {\tt <<?B, x::16, y::16 >>}        
\item {\tt \{:ball, :hide\}} : hide ball - {\tt <<?B, 0::16, 0::16>>}        
\item {\tt \{:frw, msg\}}  : raw message to client - {\tt msg}
\end{itemize}

The raw message is used for debugging, a possibility for us to
communicate direclt with the client.

\subsection*{the pong server}

Once we have the session layer working we can concentrate on building
the game engine. The ponge server needs to have a model of the game
state, know how to chnge it based on requests and broadcast the
changes to both players. The initial state of the game also needs to be
know by both clients so that the server only needs to inform the
clients of changes.

Since the rules of the game are quite extensive and needs to decide
what should happen each time the ball moves or a player wants to move
we implement this in a module of its own. The pong server will thus
know very litle about what is going on and always consult the game
module before acting on a requst. 

The state of the game is simply keepingh track of where the players
have their paddles, where the ball is and what the score is. The
server also holds the process identifiers of teh session processes to
be able to broadcast the state changes.


\begin{itemize}
\item Two players ({\tt player1} and {\tt player2}).
\item A ball.
\item The current score.
\item Two {\em session pids} to send messages to the players. 
\end{itemize}

The message that come from the session processes are request to move
the paddles. The game module is use to determin if the move is
possible and if so, an directive to move the paddle is broadcasted to
the session processes. Note that the server allways boradcast the
changes to both clients, the clienst thus receivs the same messages
from the server.

Moving the paddles in the simple problem to solve, it's a bit tricker
to handle the ball. Inorder for the ball to move the sever must
periodically calculate the new position of the ball and then update
the clients. This is solved using a call to {\tt :timer.send_after/3}
function. This function will schedule a message to a process after a
given time and we set this up to send a {\tt :tick} message after
$100 ms$. When the tick mesage is handled the ball is moved and a new
tick message is scheduled.

The last message we need to handle is a {\tt \{:serve, :player1\}} (
or {\tt :player2}) message. This is also a message that the server
schedules to be sent to itself after a second or two. When it is
received a new ball is generated and the games starts. Everytime a
player misses the ball a new serve message is scheludled.
