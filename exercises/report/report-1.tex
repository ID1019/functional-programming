\section*{Introduction}

This is what a report should look like, vanilla \LaTeX with regular
page width and height and single spaced lines. Don't use any fancy
packades that will turn your report into a christmas tree, keep it
simple!.

\section*{Sections}

Since this is a small report I can omit having numbered sections and
you do this by using section commands that end with a {\tt *}. You can
ofcourse have subsections etc. 

\section*{Inserting code}

Code sniplets are included using the package {\tt minted}. If you
want to include a program statemen in running text you can do this
using for eaxmple teletype-text: {\tt append([1,2,3],[4,5]).

\begin{minted}{elixir}
  def append([], b) do b end
  def append([h|t], b) do
    [h | append(t, b)]
  end  
\end{minted}
