\section*{Introduction}

Your task is to implement a data structure that holds the infinite
sequence of primes and can be used by the {\tt Enum} and {\tt Stream}
modules. In the end we should be able to do like this:

\begin{minted}{elixir}
  iex(10)> Enum.take( Stream.map(Primes.primes(), fn(x) -> 2*x end), 5)
  [4, 6, 10, 14, 22]
\end{minted}

The primes should implement the {\tt Enumarable} protocol and so you
should have some understanding of {\tt Struct} and {\tt Protocol} but
don't be afraid, things will work out.

\section*{Infinite sequence of primes}

Before implementing the enumerable protocol you should implement a
infinite sequence of primes using anonymous functions. We divide this
into three tasks and we start by implementing the infinite sequence of
natural numbers (starting on 3).

\subsection*{z}

The function {\tt z/1} should take one argument, an integer, and
return a function that when applied returns a tuple {\tt \{n, fun\}} where {\tt n} is the integer given
and {\tt fun} is a function that takes no argument and when applied
returns a tuple {\tt\{n+1, fun}}. The function now returned should
of course return a tuple with the firste element {\tt n+2} etc. 

This is what it should look like:

\begin{minted}{elixir}
iex(29)> z = Primes.z(3)
z = Primes.z(3)
#Function<4.106663018/0 in Primes.z/1>
iex(30)> {_, z} = z.()
{_, z} = z.()
{4, #Function<4.106663018/0 in Primes.z/1>}
iex(31)> {_, z} = z.()
{_, z} = z.()
{5, #Function<4.106663018/0 in Primes.z/1>}
iex(32)> {_, z} = z.()
{_, z} = z.()
\end{minted}

\subsection*{filter}

The next thing you should implement is a {\tt filter/2} function. This
function should take a function that can be used to generate a
sequence as above, and a number, {\tt f}, that it should use as a
filter. It should return a tuple {\tt \{p, fun\}} where {\tt p} is
the first number in the sequence that is not divisable by {\tt f}. The
function that is the second element in the tuple is a function that
will deliver the next number in the sequnce not divisable by {\tt
  f}. This is what it should look like:

\begin{minted}{elixir}
iex(55)> {_n, f} = Primes.filter(Primes.z(3), 2)
{_n, f} = Primes.filter(fn() -> Primes.z(3) end, 2)
{3, #Function<1.106663018/0 in Primes.filter/2>}
iex(56)> {_n, f} = f.()
{_n, f} = f.()
{5, #Function<1.106663018/0 in Primes.filter/2>}
iex(57)> {_n, f} = f.()
{_n, f} = f.()
{7, #Function<1.106663018/0 in Primes.filter/2>}
\end{minted}

If this works we have way of implementing a sequence of all numbers
noty divisable by two and why not continue on this path and implement
the sieve of Eratosthenes.

\subsection*{sieve}

Implement a function {\tt sieve/2} that takes a function and a (prime)
number as arguments. The function should be a sequence generator like
{\tt z} of {\tt f} in the above examples. We will assume that the
generator returns all possible primes greater than the prime given as
the second argument.

\begin{minted}{elixir}
  def sieve(n, p) do
    :
    :
  end
\end{minted}

When we say ``possible'' we mean that the numbers generated have been
filtered by all primes less than {\tt p}. How do you generate the next
prime greater than {\tt p}? Can you also generate a function that
returns all possible primes greater than this prime although they
might be divisable by the new prime that you generated?

If we you can do this, how do you let {\tt sieve/2} return a tuple
{\tt \{next, fun\}} where {\tt next} is the next prime greater than
{\tt p} and {\tt fun\} is function that returns all possible primes
  greater than, and filtered by, the prime that you have found?

\subsection*{primes}

This final thing is to boot strap everything and provide a function
{\tt primes} that returns a function that when applied generates a
tuple {\tt \{2, fun\}} where {\tt 2} of course is the first prime and
{\tt fun} is a function that will return the remaining primes.

\begin{minted}{elixir}
  def primes() do
    fn() -> {2, fn() -> .......  end} end
  end
\end{minted}

Hmm, what do we write on the dotted line? We could try with {\tt
  z(3)}; that would give us all numbers greater than 3 but we don't
want to have all the even numbers. Should we filter the number from
{\tt z(3)} with 2? Close, but that would give us the sequence 2,3,5,6
and we do not want to have 6. Ahh,
