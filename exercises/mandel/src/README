The native interface is compiled like follows:

> gcc -o depth.so -I/usr/lib/erlang/usr/include -fpic -shared depth.c

This will be loaded as the module Depth is loaded.

The depth.ex file can not be re-compiled since this will trigger
another load operation of the module. When you compile the file make
sure that you do not have previous compiled veriosn i.e. a
Elixir.Depth.beam in your directory.

> elixirc depth.ex
